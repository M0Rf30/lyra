//! Accent colour extraction from cover art.
//!
//! Lyra already keeps the raw encoded cover-art bytes for the current album
//! around for blur processing (`AppModel.cover_art_bytes`); this module
//! reuses that same byte source to pick a small, legible accent colour so
//! the now-playing surfaces can visually match the artwork instead of
//! always showing the fixed COSMIC system accent. There is no dependency on
//! `auto-palette` (Euphonica's choice) — `extract` works directly off the
//! `image` crate already in the dependency tree with a coarse HSL
//! histogram, which is more than adequate at the fixed 32x32 working
//! resolution used here.
