//! MPD playback backend — fully non-blocking.
//!
//! Sends play/pause/seek/volume commands to an MPD server. **No `block_on()`
//! calls** — all async commands are dispatched via `cosmic::task::future()`
//! and the UI is updated optimistically.  Actual MPD state is polled by a
//! background subscription that pushes `Message::MpdStatusUpdate`.
