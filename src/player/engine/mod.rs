//! Ported from `~/M0Rf30/rmpd`'s `rmpd-player` crate — see

//! `~/M0Rf30/rmpd/rmpd-player/src/`) for the architecture this is based on.
//! Key difference from rodio: DSD files can be output via DoP (DSD-over-PCM)
//! on a single dedicated code path that never touches gain/volume/EQ/resampling
//! — that separation is what guarantees a DoP stream reaches the DAC
//! unprocessed instead of risking corruption from an accidental shared
//! mixing/DSP stage.
