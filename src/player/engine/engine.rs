//! The playback-thread engine: decode → gain → EQ → volume → output.
//!
//! One dedicated [`std::thread`] per [`PlaybackEngine::play`] call owns the
//! decoder(s) and drives decode → gain → EQ → volume → output for the
//! entire remaining lifetime of the queue — surviving gapless/crossfade
//! transitions via look-ahead, only respawning on an explicit new `play()`,
//! manual skip, or `stop()`. Playback state (playing/paused) is shared via
//! an `Arc<AtomicU8>` so the hot loop never takes a lock to check pause
//! state.
//!
//! Mirrors the hot-loop *shape* of `~/M0Rf30/rmpd`'s
//! `rmpd-player/src/engine.rs` — see `local://rmpd_player_report.md`
//! (sections 2, 5, 6, 7) for the full architecture this is based on — with
//! one deliberate simplification per that report's §9: rmpd's decode
//! thread → `MultiOutput` worker → `CpalOutput`-internal-channel double hop
//! collapses to a single hop here, since lyra only ever has one output.
//! The decode thread applies ReplayGain, [`EqFilter`], and [`VolumeFilter`]
//! directly, then hands samples straight to [`CpalOutput::write`] /
//! [`DopOutput::write`] — no `MultiOutput`-equivalent fan-out type exists.
//!
//! The whole module is deliberately synchronous — no `tokio`/`async`
//! anywhere — since [`crate::player::backend::PlaybackBackend`] is a fully
//! synchronous trait.
