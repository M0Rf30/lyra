//! lossy encoders exist in pure Rust, and CD-drive ripping needs C bindings,
//! so neither is in scope here. `pipeline` decodes any symphonia-supported
//! input (audio files *and* video containers such as mp4/mkv, since
//! symphonia's probe is content-based and picks the default audio track
//! regardless of container), `encoder` writes the chosen output format, and
//! `cue` splits a single ripped file into per-track outputs from a CUE sheet.
